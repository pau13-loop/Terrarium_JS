This exercise is been made following the isntructions in the README of the link I specified above. Also the implementation of the code has been done by copying and understanding the given code. I'm pretty sure that if I've had to guess by myself how to make this terrarium responsive it could take quite a lot more time than just forty five minutes. Thank you so much to the person that create this kata, I thought it was really interesting and entrataining.
